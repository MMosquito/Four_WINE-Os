* 5/14 - minor changes to slides

* 5/8 - see "Final_Presentation_draft_v1.1.pptx"
     * created a better starter draft for everyone to view/edit
     * created 'hidden' slides that breaks down each requirement
       * this will easier to breakout each section and have one area for notes per section

 * 5/4 - see "Final_Presentation.pptx"
     * the presentation is created for everyone to view/edit
